        <h2> The Discovery of Music: The Source </h2>
        <p> See the humble farmer lost to time, standing upon a vast silhouette of mountains and clouds.

Now, he carries in his hands the first bamboo flute. From who does he learn how to fashion melodies? From where does he begin his journey into music?</p>
