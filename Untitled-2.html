            <h2> The Discovery of Music: The Source
                See the humble farmer lost to time, standing upon a vast silhouette of mountains and clouds. In his harvesting, he has heard the wind dance through the hollow bamboo—creating melodies upon the valley wind. In his curiosity, he has fashioned himself a bamboo which may do the same. Now, he carries in his hands the first bamboo flute. From who does he learn how to fashion melodies? From where does he begin his journey into music?
